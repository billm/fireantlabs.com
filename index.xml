the meterpreter shell. Most pentesters are likely to just run powershell from
the command shell that meterpreter launches with the &lt;code>shell&lt;/code> command instead
of loading the extension. But this can be problematic for environments that
lock down Powershell.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Proxmox ZFS Drive Replacement</title><link>https://fireantlabs.com/post/2021/05/proxmox-zfs-drive-replacement/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 19:04:44 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://fireantlabs.com/post/2021/05/proxmox-zfs-drive-replacement/</guid><description>&lt;p>Drive replacement is an inevitable task with computers and one that can be
nerve-wracking when you aren&amp;rsquo;t well prepared for it. I recently had a drive
failure on the root filesystem of one of my Proxmox&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> hypervisors. In
my installation, Proxmox makes use of a two drive mirrored ZFS file system for
it&amp;rsquo;s root partition. This post is as much to ensure the notes I took to recover
from the degraded volume are easy for me to find as to share the steps to
hopefully make someone elses life easier in the future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://fireantlabs.com/post/2019/06/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2019 20:19:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://fireantlabs.com/post/2019/06/hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>A proper Hello World in shellcode.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
